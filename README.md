# Project-3---Netflix-Data-Analysis

Dataset Details: This dataset consists of the following attributes [“show_id”, “type”, “title”, “director”, “cast”, “country”, “date_added”, “release_year”, “rating”]

Objective: The main purpose of analyzing this Netflix movies & tv shows dataset is to gain insights into the content available on the platform and to identify trends & patterns in the type of content, release years, countries, and ratings. This analysis can help Netflix and its stakeholders understand the user preferences and viewing habits, optimize content acquisition & production decisions, and improve the user experience on the platform. 

Basically, I will be using the 2 machine learning techniques [Collaborative filtering & Content-Based filtering] to identify patterns & make recommendations. 
Collaborative Filtering – It is a technique that can analyze the behavior of users to identify patterns and make recommendations. In this dataset, it can be used to make personalized recommendations for users based on their viewing habits and preferences. For ex: If a user frequently watches movies with a particular actor/director, this algorithm can identify other titles on the platform that have the same actor or director and recommend them to the user. 

Content-based filtering – This technique can be used to make recommendations based on the attributes of titles themselves, such as genre, cast, director and rating. For ex: If a Netflix user watches comedies, this algorithm can identify other titles on the platform that are also classified as comedies and recommend them to the user. 


List of Hypotheses to prove/disprove: 
1.	The number of movies & tv shows added to Netflix has increased over the years
2.	The US produces a majority of content on Netflix
3.	TV shows have a higher average rating than movies
4.	The most common genre on Netflix is drama
5.	The cast & director of a title have a significant impact on its rating
